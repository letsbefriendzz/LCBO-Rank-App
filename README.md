# LCBO API

Currently available at www.lcbostats.com/api/alcohol.

An early work in progress. Documentation and more to come soon.

### What is this thing?

An API used to serve information regarding alcoholic beverages stocked at the LCBO.

### Where did you get this data?

I found it on the side of the road.

### Why did you make this?

To enable open source, cost-efficient alcoholic beverage acquisition for the province of
Ontario, of course! :)


## Big Ticket TODOs

### Return Updated Records

Send a date to the `/api/alcohol/updated` and get all alcohols that have been updated since that date.
