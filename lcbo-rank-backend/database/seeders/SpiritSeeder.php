Nose: On the nose there are dry honey notes with persistent floral aromas followed by hints of butterscotch, dry heather and some cereal/short bread elements. There is also just a hint of brine, like a warm summer sea breeze. With a little water some of the sherry inspired dried fruit notes become more noticeable. Palate: On the palate it has a creamy texture and a more substantial mouth feel than its appearance would suggest. There is pepper, but with a bit of sweetness, as in a sweet chili spread or a pepper infused marmalade, followed by slight citric notes and elements of cinnamon spice and vanilla. There are also hints of smoke and light medicinal notes. The finish is long, with a distinctive dry pepper capsaicin quality set against a slightly sweetish background note. The combination of vanilla notes and dry pepper give the whisky a bit of an old fashioned gingersnap character. Score - 90. (Joe Micallef, thewhiskeywash.com, Aug. 5, 2016)",

Or if any sherry cask whisky is so clean and full of the joys of Jerez. A classic malt which has upped a gear or two and has become exactly what it is: a whisky of pure brilliance ... Score - 95.5.

Add in the peat reek, and it's reminiscent of an extinguished campfire. On a different note, the dram is quite fruity. I get bright satsuma peel and tangelo segment. Underlying the whisky to bring everything together is the faint sweetness of honeycomb.Palate: The mouthfeel is light but overwhelmingly hot. There is no sweetness to it except for maybe a kiss of honey. There is the faint mist of salt air, or sea spray. Mainly, the Ardbeg is all smoke and soot with umami or mushroom. The bright fruit on the nose hides away behind the peat; it's just not there on the palate. Rose hips with a little eucalyptus add a floral or tea-like taste. Overall, the only way to describe the taste is the smell of burnt rubber on asphalt. Adding water makes this more enjoyable than straight. Summary: The Arbeg 19-Year-Old Traigh Bhan (Batch 2) has a wonderful nose on it. You pick up on the complexities and subtleties. The palate though just was not giving me the nuances I desired that I can usually taste in other Ardbegs. I'm not fully disappointed with it as I find myself wanting to drink it. With water, it's more palatable. It is a classic Ardbeg, but I just couldn't get the notes Dr. Bill Lumsden, its creator, put out. Score - 3 Stars (out of 5).

Layered sweetness (toffee, caramel, maples syrup, elegant rum) provide a foundation for warming cinnamon, bramble, blueberry tart, sultana, light candy corn, herbal tea, and subtle marzipan. A soft, dry, polished oak finish ropes in all the sweetness, keeping me wanting more. Excellent! Score - 96. (John Hansell, Whisky Advocate, Spring 2010)",
